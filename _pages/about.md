## Who Am I?
My name is Mana Mohammadi, and I’m a 22-year-old electrical engineering student specializing in biomedical engineering. I’m currently in my fourth year at the University of Tehran, where I focus on combining engineering principles with medical sciences to solve complex healthcare problems.

## My Research Interests?

My research interests focus on the intersection of biomedical engineering, neuroscience, and computational biology. I am passionate about solving real-world problems through engineering, deep learning, and data-driven approaches—whether in healthcare, signal processing, or broader complex systems. I enjoy tackling challenges that require analytical thinking, creativity, and interdisciplinary tools to make meaningful impact.
